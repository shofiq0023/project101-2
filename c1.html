				<p class="content-p">The skyscraper stands at 127 m or 30 stories tall and was completed in 1972. When this tower was built, on the site of the former second Hotel Vancouver, its black-glass facing earned it the press sobriquet "the Black Tower", and with the white design of the adjacent Eaton's building (now Nordstrom) it was considered by some an architectural disaster. The first tenant in January 1972 was the recently formed law firm of McLaughlin, Holburn & Beaudin on the 16th floor. The firm (now permanently named Alexander Holburn Beaudin & Lang LLP) has remained a tenant since opening and currently occupies the topmost floors. The building is currently (since 1996) the home of Corus Radio Vancouver, as well as a number of law firms, including Farris, Vaughan, Wills & Murphy LLP and Alexander Holburn Beaudin & Lang LLP. The Downtown Vancouver Optometry Clinic is also a tenant. Vancouver, British Columbia, in Canada has more high-rise buildings per capita than most North American metropolitan centres with populations exceeding 1,000,000. Vancouver's population density is the 4th-highest in North America and the city has more residential high-rises per capita than any other city on the continent. There are roughly 650 high-rise buildings that equal or exceed 35 m (115 ft) and roughly 50 buildings that equal or exceed 100 metres (328 ft). Vancouver has 27 protected view corridors which limit the construction of tall buildings which interfere with the line of sight to the North Shore Mountains, the downtown skyline, and the waters of English Bay and the Strait of Georgia. Almost all of Vancouver's buildings that exceed 100 metres in height are located within Downtown Vancouver. The tallest building in Vancouver is the 62-storey, 201 m (659 ft) Living Shangri-La and represents the city's efforts to add visual interest into Vancouver's skyline. The Private Residences at Hotel Georgia completed in 2012 at 157 m (515 ft) and 48 stories is currently the third-tallest in the city. One Wall Centre, at 150 m (492 ft) tall, with 48 storeys, is currently the city's fourth tallest building. One Wall Centre has the distinction of being the first building in the world to use a tuned liquid column damper to control wind vibrations. The recently completed Trump Vancouver at 188 metres is now the city's 2nd tallest building. Vancouver's history of skyscrapers began with the Dominion Building (1909), the Sun Tower (1911) (originally named the World Tower, then the News-Advertiser Tower, after the newspaper it was home to in each case), the Vancouver Block (1912), the second Hotel Vancouver (1916) and the Marine Building (1929). The third Hotel Vancouver was completed in 1939 at 111 m (364 ft) tall, and was the first building to have stood taller than 100 m (328 ft) in the city. Building construction remained slow in the city until the late 1960s, other than the completion of the new BC Electric headquarters (soon renamed BC Hydro headquarters, and today the Electra condominiums). From 1968 to 1981, Vancouver witnessed a major expansion of skyscraper and high-rise construction. Many of the city's office towers were completed during this period, such as the Harbour Centre, Bentall Centre, Royal Centre, Granville Square and Pacific Centre office tower/mall complexes. A ten-year lull in building construction came after the expansion, though Vancouver experienced a larger second building expansion beginning in 1991 and continuing into the present. In the last two decades Vancouver's pioneering urbanism, with its density and innovative developments, has been emulated by major cities throughout the world. As part of the city's push for liveable high-density areas (called Vancouverism by planning theorists), many mixed-use and residential buildings were built, such as Concord Pacific Place, the largest master-planned residential complex in North America. One Wall Centre and Living Shangri-La were the city's first buildings to break the 150 m (492 ft) and 200 m (656 ft) marks, respectively.</p>
